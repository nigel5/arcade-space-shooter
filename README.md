# spaceBattleGame

Here's a topdown shooter game that I made with pygame for Python3.

### Prerequisites
- python-3.7
- pygame-1.9.4 for python-3.7

### How to run the game (Windows 10)
~~~
python .\spaceBattleGame.py
~~~

- Destroy as many enemy spaceships without getting destroyed yourself! 💯
- Collect health, shield, and damage crates to survive longer! ❤️
- Don't collide with the other spaceships! Lookup for the massive UFO 👾
- Beat your friend's highscores! 🏆
